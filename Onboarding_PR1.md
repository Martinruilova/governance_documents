# **ONBOARDING**

The Onboarding process (PR1) describes the creator’s enrollment journey from its application to its acceptance on the Stakes.social. A creator is any person who wants to tokenize an asset through Dev Protocol’s services. The process will begin when creators land on Stakes.social application page. Then, they will follow these steps:

## **1. Application**

Creators will need to fill up an Application Form, which contains the OSS project details, KYC requirements, and registration details.

Before submitting the form to the onboarding specialist, the creator must agree to Dev protocol’s “General Terms and Conditions”, “Onboarding Term and Conditions” and acknowledge the “Usage Charges” to be paid in further steps. The latter will contain an approximation of the OSS tokenization costs expressed in Ethereum (ETH-USD).

## **2. Screening**

The onboarding specialist and compliance officer will review the forms on Airtable by doing a formal and content verification. The screening’s filters are:

**Formal verification:** The onboarding specialist will check if everything was filled up regardless of the content and if the attachments for the KYC requirements were added. The onboarding specialist can contact applicants to resubmit the application if some mandatory fields are missing.

**Content Verification:** The application will be assessed by using an established criterion (first-timer, tokenization usage, formal documentation, GitHub activity, intellectual property, community vote, non-malicious activity). The main objective of the activity is to verify if the project complies with the requirements described in Dev protocol “General Terms and Conditions” and “Onboarding Term and Conditions”.
Once the application passes through the filters and with the approval of the compliance office, the onboarding specialist will send an authentication request to Stakes.social. The dapp will verify if the ownership of the OSS project belongs to the creator through a series of activation functions (market validation). After a successful market authentication, the creator will receive a registration invitation. It will contain an URL to continue with the registration. The creator must agree again to Dev protocol “General Terms and Conditions” and “Onboarding Term and Conditions” before starting the tokenization request. 

## **3. Registration**

Creators will need to pay a gas fee for tokenization. They must connect their wallets for staking by clicking on “sign-in” on Stakes.social main’s page and “WalletConnect”. Creators must open a wallet if they do not have one. The wallet ID must match the ID provided. The payment option is displayed after the registration form is completed.  

Once paid, the creator sends a listing request. The Stakes.social’s backend will receive it and automatically send it to a third-party Committee, which will publish the list of successful projects (those that approved the formal, content, and market verification) to increase the transparency of the process.  

The registration will be canceled, and the project will not be tokenized if the creator did not pay within three business days.
